# Cash Flow Management app

## About the project:
#### This app was made in JAVA.
As part of the course curriculum - Internet Programming, which we studied in the third year of our studies at (B.Sc.) in Computer Science, Holon Institute of Technology (H.I.T). 
We are proud to present our "Cash Flow Management" Java application which uses Derby DB in order to keep and manage a record of the user expenses.
Everyone is invited to sign up and enjoy tracking his expenses in a simple and easy way using the app that we built.
